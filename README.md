1>  Popularity-based recommenders offer a very primitive form of collaborative filtering, where items are recommended to users based on how popular those items are among other users.

Often used by Online New Sites

2>  correlation-based recommendation systems tems are recommended based on similarities in their user review. In this sense, they do take user preferences into account.  In these systems, you use Pearson's R correlation to recommend an item that is most similar to the item a user has already chosen. In other words, to recommend an item that has a review score that correlates with another item that a user has already chose The Pearson R correlation coefficient is a measure of linear correlation between two variables, or in this case, two items ratings.The Pearson correlation coefficient is represented by the symbol R and with an R value that's close to one or negative one than you know you have a strong linear relationship between two variables. As R values get closer to zero, you know that the two variables are not linearly correlated.
